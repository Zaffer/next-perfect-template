Modules
===

> Check out the [documentation about the folder structure](../README.md#modules-folder)

Summary:

- `modules`: Contains related pieces of code (components, types, utils) grouped together. See documentation below.
    - `modules/core`: Contains built-in modules included with the template preset you selected. They are being separated from other modules by default, so you can locate your own code faster.

- This folder contains modules.
- `src/modules/core` can contain core modules.
- Modules are a way to organize your code, by putting all related files together, instead of splitting them by "kind".
- You don't need to use modules.
- You should use modules if you feel like it's the right thing to do.
- Don't try to convert everything as a module at once, take it slow, discuss with other team members.
- If you're not sure, use `common` instead, and come back later if needed.
